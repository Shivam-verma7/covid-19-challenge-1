New Biophysical Approaches Reveal the Dynamics and Mechanics of Type I Viral Fusion Machinery and Their Interplay with Membranes,"Benhaim, Mark A.; Lee, Kelly K.","Protein-mediated membrane fusion is a highly regulated biological process essential for cellular and organismal functions and infection by enveloped viruses. During viral entry the membrane fusion reaction is catalyzed by specialized protein machinery on the viral surface. These viral fusion proteins undergo a series of dramatic structural changes during membrane fusion where they engage, remodel, and ultimately fuse with the host membrane. The structural and dynamic nature of these conformational changes and their impact on the membranes have long-eluded characterization. Recent advances in structural and biophysical methodologies have enabled researchers to directly observe viral fusion proteins as they carry out their functions during membrane fusion. Here we review the structure and function of type I viral fusion proteins and mechanisms of protein-mediated membrane fusion. We highlight how recent technological advances and new biophysical approaches are providing unprecedented new insight into the membrane fusion reaction.",2020,,"Viruses 2020, Vol. 12, Page 413",12,4,413-413,,10.3390/V12040413,45237,#42020,Benhaim 2020,,,42020,09-04-20
Emergence of deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during 2019–2020,"Islam, Arshi; Ahmed, Anwar; Naqvi, Irshad H.; Parveen, Shama","Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV. The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission. Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally. More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic. The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019–2020. We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness. In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present. Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe. Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results. Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.",2020,,VirusDisease,,,01-Sep,,10.1007/s13337-020-00575-1,45218,#42021,Islam 2020,,,42021,09-04-20

Noncanonical Functions of Antibodies,"Dimitrov, Jordan D.; Lacroix-Desmazes, Sébastien","<p>The typical functions of antibodies are based on linking the process of antigen recognition with initiation of innate immune reactions. With the introduction of modern research technologies and the use of sophisticated model systems, recent years have witnessed the discovery of a number of noncanonical functions of antibodies. These functions encompass either untypical strategies for neutralization of pathogens or exertion of activities that are characteristic for other proteins (cytokines, chaperones, or enzymes). Here, we provide an overview of the noncanonical functions of antibodies and discuss their mechanisms and implications in immune regulation and defense. A better comprehension of these functions will enrich our knowledge of the adaptive immune response and shall inspire the development of novel therapeutics.</p>",2020,,Trends in Immunology,0,0,,,10.1016/j.it.2020.03.006,45024,#42026,Dimitrov 2020,,,42026,09-04-20

Immune responses and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during an outbreak in Iran: Comparison with SARS and MERS,"Rokni, Mohsen; Ghasemi, Vida; Tavakoli, Zahra","Summary The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7?days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.",2020,,Reviews in Medical Virology,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/rmv.2107,45188,#42032,Rokni 2020,,,42032,09-04-20

Die Modellierung der Forscher des Imperial College, London, lassen eine übermächtige 2. Welle für den Herbst/Winter 2020 erwarten, wenn die jetzigen Maßnahmen zu lange aufrechterhalten werden. Eine baldige Lockerung der Maßnahmen ist angezeigt, um eine fraktionierte Durchseuchung der Bevölkerung, ohne konsekutive Überlastung der Versorgungsstrukturen, allen voran der Verfügbarkeit von Beatmungsplätzen, noch vor der nächsten Influenzasaison 2020/2021 zu ermöglichen. Die Aussicht auf einen allenfalls marginal vor der Zulassung geprüften Impfstoff vor Beginn der 2. Welle, der dann höchstens für Menschen mit einem sowieso hohen Risiko bei SARS-CoV‑2 in Frage käme, sollte jetzt zu keinen Verzögerungen bei den auszudifferenzierenden, intermittierenden Lockerungen führen.

COVID-19: The Uninvited Guest in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Implications for Pharmacotherapy,"Stringer, Kathleen A.; Puskarich, Michael A.; Kenes, Michael T.; Dickson, Robert P.","Abstract As the number of cases of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) rise in the United States (US), the number of severe cases (those requiring ICU admission) rise with it. Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on experience from China.1, 2 However, the World Health Organization?s (WHO) estimate from China for severe and critical cases is near 20% (Table).3 The primary clinical feature of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the severity of which directs the clinical course; it has been estimated that, of patients admitted to the ICU, up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support.4 This has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine.",2020,,Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/phar.2394,45184,#42038,Stringer 2020,,,42038,09-04-20
Therapeutic Potential for Tetracyclines in the Treatment of COVID-19,"Sodhi, Mohit; Etminan, Mahyar","Abstract Currently there is a race against time to identify prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID-19. Until these treatments are developed, tested and mass produced, it might be prudent to look into existing therapies that could be effective against this virus. Based on the available evidence we believe that tetracyclines may be effective agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Tetracyclines (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline) are highly lipophilic antibiotics that are known to chelate zinc compounds on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1. Coronaviruses are also known to heavily rely on host MMPs for survival, cell infiltration, cell to cell adhesion, and replication, many of which have zinc as part of their MMP complex2,3. It is possible that the zinc chelating properties of tetracyclines may also aid in inhibiting COVID-19 infection in humans limiting their ability to replicate within the host.",2020,,Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/phar.2395,45185,#42039,Sodhi 2020,,,42039,09-04-20
COVID-19: Important Therapy Considerations and Approaches in this Hour of Need,"Lodise, Thomas P.; Rybak, Michael J.","Abstract We are living in unprecedented times. While we had near pandemic events in the recent past with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), we have never experienced anything like coronavirus (COVID-19), also known as SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the Spanish flu. In contrast to the Spanish flu where medical care was limited, we are equipped to combat COVID-19 but there is considerable work ahead with many uncertainties. At this critical time, we must come together as one united country and world to stop the spread and provide the best care possible for individuals who contract the virus and develop infection. A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.1-3 However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.",2020,,Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/phar.2396,45186,#42040,Lodise 2020,,,42040,09-04-20
Considerations for statin therapy in patients with COVID-19,"Dashti-Khavidaki, Simin; Khalili, Hossein","Abstract Current coronavirus pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak during the current century after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.1 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an immunopathologic event and main cause of death following COVID-19. The main mechanism of ARDS is uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm following release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interferons (IFN), interleukines (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and chemokines.2-3 So, some Chinese researchers proposed or used anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment regimen of patients with COVID-19.3-4",2020,,Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/phar.2397,45187,#42041,Dashti-Khavidaki 2020,,,42041,09-04-20

Acute stroke management pathway during Coronavirus-19 pandemic,"Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio; Viaro, Federica; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna M.; Tiberio, Ivo; Munari, Marina; Causin, Francesco","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic which in our region, Veneto (Italy), dates back to February, we were confronted with several challenges, but with a constant aim of keeping our Stroke Unit COVID-free. For this reason, in addition to creating a dedicated hot-spot as a pre-triage just outside the Emergency Department, together with the Neuroradiology Unit we obtained a mobile CT unit that could be used by COVID-positive or COVID-suspected patients. Furthermore, thanks to the collaboration with colleagues from different specialties (Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine), dedicated areas for COVID patients were activated. This led to a substantial change of our acute stoke management pathway. As the number of COVID patients increased, and the WHO declared a state of pandemic, this new stroke pathway has been fully tested. We would like to share our experience and send a clear message to keep a high attention on stroke as an emergency condition, because we have observed a decreased number of patients with minor strokes and TIAs, longer onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes, and a reduced number of transfers from spokes. We strongly believe that the general population and family doctors are rightly focused on COVID. However, to remain at home with stroke symptoms does not mean to “stay safe at home”.",2020,,Neurological Sciences,,,01-Mar,,10.1007/s10072-020-04375-9,45221,#42046,Baracchini 2020,,,42046,09-04-20

DESIGN, SETTING: Observational study in the two COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhu, Anhui province, China, 24 January - 24 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients infected with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at the two designated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy). RESULTS: Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83). Univariate analysis indicated that virus clearance was slower in two patients with chronic hepatitis B infections (mean difference, 10.6 days; 95% CI, 6.2-15.1 days).

Additionally, it has become clear that this is not a bleeding diathesis but rather a predominantly pro-thrombotic DIC with high venous thromboembolism rates, elevated D-dimer levels, high fibrinogen levels in concert with low anti-thrombin levels, and pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathology in addition to mounting experience with high rates of central line thrombosis and vascular occlusive events (e.g. ischemic limbs, strokes, etc.) observed by those who care for critically ill COVID-19 patients (1-7). There is evidence in both animals and humans that fibrinolytic therapy in Acute Lung Injury and ARDS improves survival, which also points to fibrin deposition in the pulmonary microvasculature as a contributory cause of ARDS and would be expected to be seen in patients with ARDS and concomitant diagnoses of DIC on their laboratory values such as what is observed in more than 70% of those who die of COVID-19 (8-10).",2020,,Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis,n/a,n/a,,,10.1111/jth.14828,45176,#42076,Wang 2020,,,42076,09-04-20

CHINA'S OLDEST CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS,"Huang, Yan-Mei; Hong, Xue-Zhi; Shen, Jian; Huang, Yi; Zhao, Hai-Lu","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) represents a global human pandemic. As of March 16, 2020, 167,515 cases were reported in 151 countries and regions. The death toll worldwide has reached 6,606, far exceeding the fatalities of two other coronavirus diseases—severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)—combined.1 Clinical studies consistently show that critical conditions and deaths associated with COVID‐19 occurred particularly in older adults, especially those with chronic multimorbidity.2, 3 Extraordinarily, five older patients aged 98 years and over were discharged from hospitals, four of whom were in Wuhan—the epicenter of the global outbreak. Here we present their successful stories to inspire medical staff, patients, and the public. The first case was the oldest so far reported. A 103‐year‐old woman who had a confirmed positive nucleic acid test result for COVID‐19 on March 1 was admitted to the Li‐Yuan Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.4 She was bedridden with preexisting Alzheimer's disease and other comorbidities. Ward physicians and nurses tried hard to communicate with her accurately. Computed tomography (CT) imaging proved pleural effusion. Her condition was severe at admission yet improved with nurses' care and supportive treatments. She became nucleic acid negative on March 6 and returned home two days later. The second patient was a 98‐year‐old woman who presented with constant fever (>38.5°C) and fatigue on February 3.5 She lived with her 79‐year‐old daughter, and her 49‐year‐old granddaughter, who lived elsewhere, joined them for the Chinese Spring Festival. The three women showed COVID‐19 pneumonia as confirmed by CT scan and nucleic acid tests. They were admitted to the Wuhan First Hospital and shared a ward on February 13. After 10 more days of supportive therapies and individualized nutritional supplementation, the 98‐year‐old woman, together with her daughter and granddaughter, was confirmed to be COVID‐19‐free and was thus released the same day on March 3. The third case was also a 98‐year‐old woman who had a high body temperature > 40°C in early February.5 Considering her critically ill condition, she and her 55‐year‐old daughter, who also had the virus, were transferred to an intensive care unit in a makeshift hospital on the evening of February 13; they were discharged on March 1. The major treatments included anti‐infection medication, intensive nursing care, and nutritional supplementation. Despite her heart failure, she was joyfully all cleared from the severe lung infection. The fourth case who recovered from the coronavirus infection was a 98‐year‐old bishop.6 The pastor was diagnosed with COVID‐19 pneumonia on February 3 and treated at the Central Hospital in Nanyang, Henan province, which shares its border with Hubei, the province at the heart of the epidemic. He has tested negative since February 12 and was discharged two days later. In addition to the viral infection, the bishop had comorbidities such as arrhythmia and pleural effusions. He was treated with a thoracic drainage catheter and his recovery was exceptional. The last infected patient was a 101‐year‐old man who spent a week in the Wuhan Third Hospital.7 He became unwell in February and was immediately hospitalized after being diagnosed with the viral infection. His doctor claimed that the determined pensioner had concentrated on getting better soon so he could go home and take care of his 92‐year‐old wife. During hospitalization, the 101‐year‐old gentleman insisted on taking care of himself and was always the first to get up early for a morning walk. He clearly knew that “It is no bother and I can just do it.” Thanks to the significant commitment, hard work, and intensive care from the frontline medical staff and the Chinese government, these five oldest patients clearly show that age is definitely not a barrier to recovering from the nfection. These successful stories are indeed a joy to the world: Joy can be “infectious” and “pandemic” too.",2020,,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,,,,,10.1111/jgs.16462,45112,#42080,Huang 2020,,,42080,09-04-20

Analyzing Situational Awareness through Public Opinion to Predict Adoption of Social Distancing Amid Pandemic COVID-19,"Qazi, Atika; Qazi, Javaria; Naseer, Khulla; Zeeshan, Muhammad; Hardaker, Glenn; Maitama, Jaafar Zubairu; Haruna, Khalid","COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response towards social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources formal (p=0.001) and informal (p=0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness p=0.000. It can, therefore, be concluded that increase situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.

We focus on the human day-to-day activity introduced by commuting to a central place for the social activity. We assume that the community is classified into two subpopulations: commuter and non-commuter, of which the commuter has two phases of the day-to-day activity: private and social. Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.",2020,,Journal of Mathematical Biology,,,Jan-32,,10.1007/s00285-020-01491-0,45208,#42089,Seno 2020,,,42089,09-04-20

As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, the extrapulmonary symptoms of the disease have emerged, especially the symptoms related to the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well-known and likely the principal mode of transmission of this disease, the possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenario. In this review article, we summarized the published literatures to date concerning four different aspects: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (b) microbiologic and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention/control infection in the digestive endoscopy room.

The virus has now spread to over 168 countries including the United States, where the first cluster of cases was observed in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington. Given the rapid increase in the number of cases in many localities, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit.

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (ΔG), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (ΔG= -9.8 kcal/mol) &Raltegravir (ΔG= -7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (ΔG= -9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (ΔG= -8.4 kcal/mol) for 2'-OMTase]. After the extensive computational analysis, we proposed that Raltegravir, Paritaprevir, Bictegravir and Dolutegravir are excellent lead candidates for these crucial proteins and they could become potential therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.",2020,,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,,,Jan-40,,10.1080/07391102.2020.1753577,45114,#42096,Khan 2020,,,42096,09-04-20

In a containment-based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management. Using 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes and our in-house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified. Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe-free real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID50/mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses.

"Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic at the County Level in Hubei Province, China","Yang, Wentao; Deng, Min; Li, Chaokui; Huang, Jincai","Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics or patterns of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic is critical in effectively preventing and controlling this epidemic. However, no research analyzed the spatial dependency and temporal dynamics of 2019-nCoV. Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann&ndash;Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran&rsquo;s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic.",2020,,"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2020, Vol. 17, Page 2563",17,7,2563-2563,,10.3390/IJERPH17072563,45240,#42100,Yang 2020,,,42100,09-04-20

Coronavirus: Update Related to the Current Outbreak of COVID-19,"Gabutti, Giovanni; d’Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando","In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China. Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.

The overall inadequate preparation of the rehabilitation system to face a sudden epidemic was clear, and similar to that of the acute services. The original idea of confining the Covid-19 cases to some areas of rehabilitation wards and/or hospitals, preserving others, proved not to be feasible. Continuous reorganization and adaptation were required due to the rapid changes. Overall, rehabilitation needs had to surrender to the more acute emergency, with total conversion of beds, wards and even hospitals. The quarantine needs heavily involved also outpatient services that were mostly closed. Rehabilitation professionals needed support, but also acted properly, again similarly to what happened in the acute wards. The typical needs of rehabilitation, such as human and physical contacts, but also social interactions including patient, team, family and caregivers, appeared clearly in the current unavoidable need of being suppressed.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System,"Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J.; Raizada, Mohan K.; Grant, Maria B.; Oudit, Gavin Y.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), facilitator of amino acid transport, and the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated RAS. Recombinant human ACE2 has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the RAS, together with implications for the COVID-19 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.",2020,,Circulation research,,,,,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317015,45124,#42135,Gheblawi 2020,,,42135,09-04-20

Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection. Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon. However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19.

Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection.

On 31 March the media reported on a dossier from the Doctors’ Association UK detailing numerous instances of medical and nursing staff being warned, disciplined, threatened, monitored, and gagged for speaking out on social or mainstream media.1 Their concerns included a lack of personal protective equipment and testing for covid-19—putting them, their families, and their patients at risk.2 The staff also highlighted what they saw as inconsistent and unconvincing guidance from their employers and national authorities.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19,"Ferner, Robin E.; Aronson, Jeffrey K.","Use of these drugs is premature and potentially harmful The BMJ in 1925 cautiously endorsed Moellgaard’s gold treatment for tuberculosis,1 although it found his pharmacological reasoning “both interesting and instructive.”2 We should be similarly cautious about proposed treatments for people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19. Many proposals are based on in vitro investigations, studies in experimental animals, or experience with interventions in infections with other viruses, whether similar to SARS-CoV-2 (eg, SARS-CoV-1) or not (HIV). This is all true of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, both 4-aminoquinolines, which have been suggested as potential treatments for covid-19. Currently, at least 80 trials of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or both, sometimes in combination with other drugs, are registered worldwide. The possible activity of 4-aminoquinolines in infectious mononucleosis was first proposed in 1960, before its viral cause was known.3 Several unsatisfactory clinical trials followed, some with positive results and some negative. In 1967 the authors of a small but well conducted randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of chloroquine concluded that “except for supportive measures, infectious mononucleosis is essentially untreatable.”4 Since then, many studies have shown that 4-aminoquinolines are …",2020,,BMJ,369,,m1432-m1432,,10.1136/bmj.m1432,45198,#42147,Ferner 2020,,,42147,09-04-20

Of course, one wishes them all a speedy recovery. It does seem, however, that central government has been a bit sketchy in following its own official advice on social distancing, to put it mildly: the prime minister actually boasted that, on an early March hospital visit, he had still shaken hands with people.3 You also have to wonder about the cleaning standards at 10 Downing Street.

Should chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine be used to treat COVID-19? A rapid review,"Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin","BACKGROUND: On the 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM: To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS: There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians. These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.",2020,,BJGP open,,,,,10.3399/bjgpopen20X101069,45152,#42154,Gbinigie 2020,,,42154,09-04-20

Childhood Rheumatic Diseases and COVID-19 Pandemic: An Intriguing Linkage and a New Horizon,"Haşlak, Fatih; Yıldız, Mehmet; Adrovic, Amra; Barut, Kenan; Kasapçopur, Özgür","As it is known, we are all in a pandemic situation due to a novel coronavirus, officially named ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"" and the disease caused by the virus named ""Coronavirus disease-2019"". The virus seems to has propensity to infect older male individuals with underlying disease. The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Not only, the disease seems to be rare and have a milder course in pediatric age but also respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and death are extremely rare. Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course. However, there is a lack of data regarding the effects of ""Coronavirus disease-2019"" on pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, there are three controversial circumstances that patients with rheumatic diseases are believed to be more likely to have viral infections like ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"", on the other hand, antirheumatic drugs may have a protective and therapeutic role in Coronavirus disease-2019 and children are more unlikely to have serious disease course. Therefore, we aimed to have a contributor role for explaining this conundrum and present a bird's eye view regarding this equivocal issue in this review.",2020,,Balkan medical journal,,,,,10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.4.43,45126,#42157,Haşlak 2020,,,42157,09-04-20
Decontamination and Reuse of N95 Respirators with Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor to Address Worldwide Personal Protective Equipment Shortages During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Schwartz, Antony; Stiegel, Matthew; Greeson, Nicole; Vogel, Andrea; Thomann, Wayne; Brown, Monte; Sempowski, Gregory D.; Alderman, Thomas Scott; Condreay, James Patrick; Burch, James; Wolfe, Cameron; Smith, Becky; Lewis, Sarah","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of strain on resources in the health care setting. One of the most pressing issues is the rapid depletion of personal protective equipment (PPE) used in the care of patients. This is a significant concern for health care workers’ health and safety. Many entities have depleted or soon will exhaust their stockpile of PPE despite adopting PPE-sparing practices as the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States increases at an almost exponential rate and manufacturers struggle to keep up with the worldwide demand. This potential shortage is particularly concerning for commonly used N95 respirators and powered-air purifying respirators (PAPRs). Recently, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)1 even temporarily suspended the requirement to perform annual fit testing of respirators to allow entities to conserve respirators and preserve them for patient care. These measures are unprecedented and highlight the urgent need for entities to develop solutions to proactively address what could be potentially a grave occupational health issue. At Duke University and Health System, we have evaluated and will begin using hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate and reuse N95 respirators. In this communication, we briefly discuss the decontamination validation process and post-decontamination performance validation conducted at Duke. This validation, which is supported by previous laboratory testing, funded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), demonstrated that N95 respirators still met performance requirements even after decontamination with hydrogen peroxide vapor in the laboratory setting for over 50 times.2 While previous studies have shown the applicability of the hydrogen peroxide vapor process, we have also confirmed that the respirator still functions as designed, using our standardized human N95 fit testing methodology. We will now use this internally validated and Duke Institutional Biosafety Review Committee (IBRC)–approved laboratory decontamination process in the clinical setting to dramatically extend the life of our N95 respirators. We hope that sharing our processes through this brief communication can help other entities with access to hydrogen peroxide vapor to evaluate the potential applicability of this technology at their facility or partner with those who may already have this capability, including other private-sector life science organizations. Process/Method We, like others, have implemented many Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–approved N95 reuse practices, including employees reusing their own N95s for the duration of their shifts. However, this alone may not be adequate to meet our anticipated need with various centers reporting multiple-fold higher use of PPE as their caseload increases. In the interest of our workforce safety, the goal was thus to extend the life of our existing supply. Duke University houses one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) as part of a nationwide network of high-containment laboratories and has extensive experience with the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination. In addition, Duke University Health System had past experience with hydrogen peroxide vapor in the clinical setting as part of previous high-consequence pathogen preparedness exercises. The Duke RBL, a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, contains a room specifically designed to use hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate laboratory equipment and has been operational for over a decade. This room currently uses a Bioquell (Horsham, PA, USA) ClarusTM C system with a 35% hydrogen peroxide solution and distribution system to disperse hydrogen peroxide vapor into the room in a uniform fashion. In addition, we are evaluating the new Bioquell Z-2 and Bioquell ProteQ systems that will provide increased capacity and flexibility to our reprocessing needs. The FDA-funded project, referenced previously, validated the decontaminat on of N95 respirators with hydrogen peroxide vapor for over 50 cycles with the reuse limiting factor being the elastic straps that started to show degradation.2 To address this, we plan to decontaminate and reuse N95s up to 30 cycles with a quality assurance (QA) step to ensure both qualitative and quantitative degradation has not occurred. A cohort of respirators will be decontaminated with every cycle and will be used in standardized quantitative fit testing to ensure the integrity of the respirators is maintained over many decontamination cycles. Procedures Approximately 100 3M (St. Paul, MN, USA) 1860 N95s, previously used in quantitative employee fit testing, were collected and laid out on stainless steel wire racks in our hydrogen peroxide vapor processing room in the RBL. The hydrogen peroxide vapor run consisted of the following 5 stages: conditioning, pregassing, gassing, gassing dwell, and aeration. The existing RBL hydrogen peroxide vapor standard operating procedure (SOP) was employed and requires that the processing room attain a 480+-ppm level of hydrogen peroxide vapor with a “gassing” time of 25 minutes and a “gassing dwell” time of 20 minutes. At the end of a cycle, during the aeration stage, fresh air was introduced into the room to increase the rate of catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide vapor into oxygen and water. This procedure leaves no residue other than water. When sufficient time had passed, we used a PortaSens II sensor (Analytical Technology, Inc., Collegeville, PA, USA) to ensure hydrogen peroxide levels were below the OSHA permissible exposure limit3 (PEL) of 1.0 ppm prior to entering the room. In addition, we validated the efficacy of the decontamination process by using 9 individual 6-log biological indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores). See Figure 1 for representation of the decontamination setup and placement of biological indicators.

SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible as each person with COVID-19 infects approximately 2.2 close contacts, and asymptomatic transmission has been reported [2,3]. SARS-CoV-2 survives in aerosols and on surfaces from hours to days, respectively [4]. Therefore, we believe non-clinical areas are potentially high-risk for transmission between healthcare workers, and often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols. To alert others to this risk and how it may be reduced, we describe our non-clinical workplace infection prevention and control measures that have been modified from those originally developed during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [5].",2020,,Anaesthesia,n/a,n/a,,,10.1111/anae.15075,45168,#42162,Ling 2020,,,42162,09-04-20

Although most initial cases occurred in China, the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries. This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of COVID-19 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in COVID-19 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality.

"COVID-19 in the Nuclear Medicine Department, be prepared for ventilation scans as well! [Letter]","Zuckier, Lionel S.; Gordon, Sharon R.","We read with great interest the recent editorial by Huang et al.[1] regarding the unfortunately timely topic of considerations attendant to running a nuclear medicine department in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, which complements similar work on diagnostic imaging [2] and hospital-wide preparedness [3]. As the pandemic has unfolded in a somewhat sequential manner [4], lessons learned in one geographic domain are of great value to physicians who practice in locations that are earlier on the learning curve. One area of concern which we did not see covered in the comprehensive treatment relates to performance of ventilation scans, a standard component of ventilation/perfusion studies performed to exclude pulmonary embolus [5]. The population of patients who are short-of-breath and considered for pulmonary embolus certainly overlap with individuals who may be suffering effects of COVID-19 infection. Beyond standard methods of decontamination, which are relevant to all patients with suspicion of infection [2,6], is there a specific concern that patients performing ventilation studies will expose others to airborne virus by exhalation into the aerosolization system? Do we need to take any additional precautions to minimize airborne distribution of virus, such as requiring technologists to don respiratory mask to protect against airborne virus? Are there any changes in protocol that we can implement to mitigate risk?",2020,,Nuclear Medicine Communications,41,5,494-495,,,44994,#42185,Zuckier 2020,,,42185,09-04-20

Strategies to trace back the origin of COVID-19,"Zhang, Xu; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Roy, Ayan; Shen, Yongyi","In spite of considerable research advancements on SARS-CoV-2, the origin of the virus is yet ambiguous. Chinese authorities originally announced that the first infection case was reported on December 31, 2019, and many of the initial cases were linked directly to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province.5 Apart from fish and seafood, the market also sold domestic and wild animals. Thirty-three of the 585 environmental samples collected from the market were found to contain the novel coronavirus, according to China CDC. The hypothesis that the outbreak originated at the market, with its initial transmission from live animals to human beings followed by rapid human-to-human transmission, is suggested to be most likely and convincing.6 However, another recent study claimed that the first patient, diagnosed on December 1, 2019, was never exposed to the market.7 Thus, origin of the disease still remains a puzzle unresolved. Identification and subsequent elimination of the zoonotic source appears to be the most imperative and demanding task at present to prevent further events of viral spillover at the animal-human interface.8 The seafood market was closed on January 1, 2020, and existing animals had been cleaned up, making it very difficult to identify the intermediate hosts. However, tracing the source of the virus might be targeted from the following perspectives:",,,Journal of Infection,,,,,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.032,44913,#42245,,,,42245,09-04-20

She traveled to Dubai from January 29 to February 10, 2020, and Egypt from February 11 to February 21, 2020. When she stayed in Egypt, she ever participated an eight-day tourism on a Nile cruise boat. She returned to Taiwan via an international airline on February 21, 2020. She began to suffer from general malaise, myalgia, cold sweating, productive cough, and sore throat since February 18, 2020. She reported that there were another 16 persons in the same tourism group had similar symptoms at that time. Her symptoms persisted despite medication, prescribed on February 21 by a local medical doctor. On February. 26, the cough exacerbated, and she developed chest tightness, abdominal upset and vomiting. She visited the Department of Emergency of a teaching hospital in Taipei on February 28. No fever was noted during her disease course. In the context of her travel history and prominent respiratory symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for test of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the result was positive. She was then transferred to a negative-pressure isolation room as a case of COVID-19. The most interesting point of this patient is where she contracted her COVID-19. By history, she is more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection while travelling abroad. However, despite that the median incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.1 days, it might be as long as more than three weeks in some extreme cases.6,7 Therefore, an argument that she got the infection while she was in Taiwan couldn't be excluded completely",,,Journal of Infection,,,,,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.031,44912,#42246,,,,42246,09-04-20

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. Results: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. Conclusions: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated. Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level IV.

Competing endogenous RNA network profiling reveals novel host dependency factors required for MERS-CoV propagation,"Zhang, X.; Chu, H.; Wen, L.; Shuai, H.; Yang, D.; Wang, Y.; Hou, Y.; Zhu, Z.; Yuan, S.; Yin, F.; Chan, J. F. W.; Yuen, K. Y.","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an integral component of the host competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. These noncoding RNAs are characterized by their unique splicing reactions to form covalently closed loop structures and play important RNA regulatory roles in cells. Recent studies showed that circRNA expressions were perturbed in viral infections and circRNAs might serve as potential antiviral targets. We investigated the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (Calu-3) cells infected with the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A total of ≥49337 putative circRNAs were predicted. Among the 7845 genes which generated putative circRNAs, 147 (1.9%) of them each generated ≥30 putative circRNAs and were involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes, including viral infections. Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that the proportion of DE circRNAs significantly (P < 0.001) increased at 24 h-post infection. These DE circRNAs were clustered into 4 groups according to their time-course expression patterns and demonstrated inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations in the predicted functions of their host genes. Our comprehensive circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identified 7 key DE circRNAs involved in various biological processes upon MERS-CoV infection. Specific siRNA knockdown of two selected DE circRNAs (circFNDC3B and circCNOT1) significantly reduced MERS-CoV load and their target mRNA expression which modulates various biological pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ubiquitination pathways. These results provided novel insights into the ceRNA network perturbations, biological relevance of circRNAs, and potential host-targeting antiviral strategies for MERS-CoV infection.",2020,,Emerging microbes & infections,9,1,733-746,,10.1080/22221751.2020.1738277,44862,#42285,Zhang 2020,,,42285,09-04-20

Influences of cyclosporin A and non-immunosuppressive derivatives on cellular cyclophilins and viral nucleocapsid protein during human coronavirus 229E replication,"Ma-Lauer, Yue a b; Zheng, Yu a b; Malesevic, Miroslav c; von Brunn, Brigitte a b; Fischer, Gunter d; von Brunn, Albrecht a b","The well-known immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A inhibits replication of various viruses including coronaviruses by binding to cellular cyclophilins thus inactivating their cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase function. Viral nucleocapsid proteins are inevitable for genome encapsidation and replication. Here we demonstrate the interaction between the N protein of HCoV-229E and cyclophilin A, not cyclophilin B. Cyclophilin inhibitors abolish this interaction. Upon infection, cyclophilin A stays evenly distributed throughout the cell, whereas cyclophilin B concentrates at ER-bleb-like structures. We further show the inhibitory potential of non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives Alisporivir, NIM811, compound 3 on HCoV-229E-GFP and -Luciferase replication in human Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells at 18 and 48 h time points post infection with EC50 s at low micromolar ranges. Thus, non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives effectively inhibit HCoV-229E replication suggesting them as possible candidates for the treatment of HCoV infection. The interruption of interaction between CypA and N protein by CsA and its derivatives suggest a mechanism how CypA inhibitors suppress viral replication., Highlights:, * HCoV-229E replication is inhibited by Alisporivir, NIM811 and other non-immunosuppressive Cyclosporin A derivatives., * HCoV-229E N protein interacts with cyclophilin A., * Cyclophilin A is required for coronavirus replication., * Cyclophilin B concentrates in bleb-like structures of the ER in HCoV-infected Huh7 cells., (C) 2020Elsevier, Inc.",2020,,Antiviral Research January,173,,104620,,,44815,#42307,Ma-Lauer 2020,,,42307,09-04-20

Este Novo Coronavírus produz a doença classificada como COVID-19, sendo agente causador de uma série de casos de pneumonia na cidade de Wuhan (China) [1]. Ainda não há informações plenas sobre a história natural, nem medidas de efetividade inquestionáveis para manejo clínico dos casos de infecção humana pelo SARS-CoV-2, restando ainda muitos detalhes a serem esclarecidos [1]. No entanto, sabe-se que o vírus tem alta transmissibilidade e provoca uma síndrome respiratória aguda que varia de casos leves ­ cerca de 80% ­ a casos muito graves com insuficiência respiratória ­entre 5% e 10% dos casos. Sua letalidade varia, principalmente, conforme a faixa etária (Quadro 1) e condições clínicas associadas. Portanto, é necessário agir. Para esse fim, as melhores e mais recentes evidências foram utilizadas na redação deste documento. Pela dinâmica da epidemia e da produção de conhecimento associada a ela, as informações podem sofrer alterações conforme avance o conhecimento sobre a doença. Dessa forma, este protocolo específico para serviços de Atenção Primária à Saúde / Estratégia Saúde da Família (APS/ESF) nos cenários de transmissão comunitária vai ser atualizado sempre que necessário. Fique atento a novas versões! A APS/ESF é a porta de entrada do Sistema Único de Saúde. Durante surtos e epidemias, a APS/ESF tem papel fundamental na resposta global à doença em questão. A APS/ESF oferece atendimento resolutivo, além de manter a longitudinalidade e a coordenação do cuidado em todos os níveis de atenção à saúde, com grande potencial de identificação precoce de casos graves que devem ser manejados em serviços especializados.O objetivo deste documento é definir o papel dos serviços de APS/ESF no manejo e controle da infecção COVID-19, bem como disponibilizar os instrumentos de orientação clínica para os profissionais que atuam na porta de entrada do SUS a partir da transmissão comunitária de CoVId-19 no Brasil. Considerando a existência de fase de transmissão comunitária da COVID-19, é imprescindível que os serviços de APS/ESF trabalhem com abordagem sindrômica do problema, não exigindo mais a identificação do fator etiológico por meio de exame específico. Desta forma, este protocolo foca na abordagem clínica da Síndrome Gripal e da Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SRAG), independentemente do agente etiológico. Como é de conhecimento de todos, múltiplos agentes virais são responsáveis por essas duas síndromes, sendo o vírus da Influenza o de maior magnitude nos últimos anos. Entretanto, há evidências e dados internacionais indicando que a transcendência da COVID-19 pode superar a da Influenza. Portanto, a abordagem pragmática deste protocolo unifica as condutas referentes a esses dois grupos de vírus.",2020,,,,,,,,44737,#42333,Brasil 2020,,,42333,09-04-20

Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment,"Rosa, Sandro G. Viveiros; Santos, Wilson C.","The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.",2020,,Rev Panam Salud Publica,,,,32256547,10.26633/RPSP.2020.40,50439,#42760,Rosa 2020,,,42760,09-04-20

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.",2020,,Rev Cardiovasc Med,,,,32259899,10.31083/j.rcm.2020.01.42,50369,#42773,McCullough 2020,,,42773,09-04-20
KCDC Risk Assessments on the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea,"Kim, Inho; Lee, Jia; Lee, Jihee; Shin, Eensuk; Chu, Chaeshin; Lee, Seon Kui","Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the risk assessments of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), from the point of detection to the provision of basic information to the relevant public health authorities. Methods: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (""very low,"" ""low,"" ""moderate,"" ""high,"" and ""very high"") for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. Results: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8(th) to February 28(th), 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: ""low"" (first), ""moderate"" (second), ""high"" (third), ""high"" (fourth), ""high"" (fifth), ""high"" (sixth), ""high"" (seventh), and ""very high"" (eighth).

Cross-Country Comparison of Case Fatality Rates of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2,"Khafaie, Morteza Abdullatif; Rahim, Fakher","Objectives: Case fatality rates (CFR) and recovery rates are important readouts during epidemics and pandemics. In this article, an international analysis was performed on the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Data were retrieved from accurate databases according to the user's guide of data sources for patient registries, CFR and recovery rates were calculated for each country. A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases >/= 1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. Results: Italy's CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%). The data showed that even though Italy was the only European country reported on 12(rd) March, Spain and France had the highest CFR of 6.16 and 4.21%, respectively, on 23(rd) March, which was strikingly higher than the overall CFR of 3.61%. Conclusion: Obtaining detailed and accurate medical history from COVID-19 patients, and analyzing CFR alongside the recovery rate, may enable the identification of the highest risk areas so that efficient medical care may be provided. This may lead to the development of point-of-care tools to help clinicians in stratifying patients based on possible requirements in the level of care, to increase the probabilities of survival from COVID-19 disease.",2020,,Osong Public Health Res Perspect,,,,32257772,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03,50425,#42918,Khafaie 2020,,,42918,09-04-20

It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. Methods and analysis: We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (L.OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts.

When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: A SEIR modeling analysis,"Wan, Kangkang; Chen, Jing; Lu, Changming; Dong, Lanlan; Wu, Zhicheng; Zhang, Lianglu","Background: Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. Method: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. Results: The optimal parameters were estimated as R0 = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. Conclusions: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly. It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.",2020,,J Glob Health,,,,32257174,10.7189/jogh.10.011002,50433,#44411,Wan 2020,,,44411,09-04-20

An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19,"Harris, Carlyn; Carson, Gail; Baillie, J. Kenneth; Horby, Peter; Nair, Harish","Background: On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. Methods: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Conclusions: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.",2020,,J Glob Health,,,,32257173,10.7189/jogh.10-011001,50434,#44413,Harris 2020,,,44413,09-04-20
COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?,"Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke","Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is paramount. There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review aimed to collate information available in published articles to identify any evidence behind these claims with the aim of advising clinicians on how best to treat patients. This review found no published evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if utilised in the early acute phase of infection, however, conflicting evidence from the World Health Organisation surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. Given the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.",2020,,Ecancermedicalscience,,,,32256706,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023,50437,#44723,Russell 2020,,,44723,09-04-20
Associations between immune-suppressive and stimulating drugs and novel COVID-19-a systematic review of current evidence,"Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; George, Gincy; Santaolalla, Aida; Cope, Andrew; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke","Background: Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs. This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. Methods: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. Results: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFalpha blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFalpha agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.",2020,,Ecancermedicalscience,,,,32256705,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022,50438,#44724,Russell 2020,,,44724,09-04-20

Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3+/- 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others.

In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable. However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic. Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.",2020,,Arch Acad Emerg Med,,,,32259130,,50409,#45337,Kolifarhood 2020,,,45337,09-04-20
Metronidazole; a Potential Novel Addition to the COVID-19 Treatment Regimen,"Gharebaghi, Reza; Heidary, Fatemeh; Moradi, Mohammad; Parvizi, Maryam","Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic. This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death. Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection. In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL12, IL1alpha, and interferon (IFN)gamma, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation. Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.",2020,,Arch Acad Emerg Med,,,,32259129,,50410,#45339,Gharebaghi 2020,,,45339,09-04-20

To accomplish this, all people are asked to participate in the screening process using the MOH's self-assessment portal (salamat.gov.ir). Health workers and public volunteers actively contact suspected cases using information recorded in this portal, as well as the electronic health record (SIB portal). They actively evaluate individuals, follow-up them, and provide them with necessary information. Where needed, clients are referred to 16-hour treatment clinics, which are specifically set up for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, to the hospitals, or will be treated at home.

"Daily Situation Report on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran; March 22, 2020",,"To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-alpha was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.",2020,,Aging Dis,,,,32257537,10.14336/AD.2020.0228,50430,#45539,Leng 2020,,,45539,09-04-20

Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection. We found experimentally that cats are susceptible to airborne infection. Our study provides important insights into the animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.",2020,,Science,,,eabb7015,,10.1126/science.abb7015,53738,#45712,Shi 2020,,,45712,09-04-20
Effective containment explains subexponential growth in recent confirmed COVID-19 cases in China,"Maier, Benjamin F.; Brockmann, Dirk","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.",2020,,Science,,,eabb4557,,10.1126/science.abb4557,53739,#45713,Maier 2020,,,45713,09-04-20
