Pathogenesis following infection with these viruses is characterized by a marked delay in the induction of Type I interferon (IFN I) and, subsequently, by a poor adaptive immune response.

      "Introduction\n",
      "Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have attracted significant interest as a novel platform in nanobiotechnology and biomedicine because of their convenient surface bioconjugation with molecular probes1 and their remarkable optical2 and immunological3 properties. Recently published examples include applications of GNPs to genomics, biosensorics, immunoassays, clinical chemistry, detection and control of microorganisms, cancer cell photothermolysis, targeted delivery of drugs or other substances, and optical imaging and monitoring of biological cells and tissues.4–6 Noteworthy is the fact that GNPs are being increasingly administered to animals and humans parenterally. In particular, they serve as carriers for the delivery of drugs, genetic materials, and antigens. “Colloidal metallic gold is not bio-inert”—such is the name Brown et al.\n",
      "7 gave to their article so as to stress the importance of nanometer size in biological effects, even for such a seemingly inert material as gold.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "It is natural to suppose that the first cells that GNPs encounter on their way in the mammalian organism are those of the immune system, in particular its phagocytic link (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells). Indeed, as early as in the first attempts to investigate colloidal gold biodistribution, which were performed in the 1960s–80s on rabbits,8 mice,9 and rats10,11 it was found that after parenteral administration, colloidal gold particles are captured by liver cells, excreted through bile, and eliminated from the organism with feces. After injection, gold was identified mostly in Kupffer cells. Perhaps Scott et al.\n",
      "8 were the first to note that the phagocytosis of GNPs is size dependent. Besides Hardonk et al.,10 the important role of Kupffer cells in the elimination of GNPs was established by Sadauskas et al.,12 who injected GNPs intravenously in mice. Electron microscopy showed that after injection, the GNPs accumulated in the macrophages of the liver (90%) and spleen (10%). The authors concluded that GNPs penetrate only phagocytes, primarily the Kupffer cells of the liver. In a subsequent study,13 Sadauskas et al. reported that GNPs get localized in lysosomes (endosomes) of Kupffer cells and can be retained there for up to six months. The influence of size, solubility and surface modification on the biocompatibility of GNPs and their use in biological applications is well known.14,15 However, the effects of nanoparticle properties on the immune system are still being explored.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In this review, we discuss the selective penetration of GNPs into immune cells and the interaction of GNPs with immune cell receptors. This review also summarizes what is known about the application of GNPs as an antigen carrier and adjuvant in immunization for the preparation of antibodies in vivo.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "The immune system cells constitute the first barrier to nanoparticle penetration of animal tissues and cells. Therefore, the study of GNP interactions with phagocytes, the mechanisms of intracellular uptake, and the responses of immune cells to GNPs is undoubtedly of major interest. Perhaps the first detailed consideration of these issues can be found in Shukla et al.,16 who, using three microscopic methods, examined the uptake of 3 nm GNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The conclusion from their study was that small GNPs enter macrophages through pinocytosis and get localized mostly in lysosomes and in the perinuclear space. On the whole, Shukla et al.'s data indicate that the GNPs are biocompatible, noncytotoxic and nonimmunogenic and that they suppress the production of reactive oxygen species and do not cause elaboration of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL1-β (which contradicts the data of Yen et al.\n",
      "17). In contrast to data by Shukla et al.,16 Yen et al.\n",
      "17 noted that on the administration of GNPs, the number of macrophages decreases and their size increases, this being accompanied by elevated production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α. We emphasize that the data of Shukla et al.\n",
      "16 were obtained for very small (3 nm) particles. However, Lim et al.,18 using much larger (60 nm) hollow NSphs capped with dextran, and Zhang et al.,19 using 60 nm GNPs, achieved results similar to the findings of Shukla et al.\n",
      "16 for the same cell culture. Sumbayev et al.\n",
      "20 showed that citrate-stabilized GNPs specifically downregulate, in a size dependent manner, the cellular responses induced by IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In a recent study, Guevél et al.\n",
      "21 demonstrated that 12 nm gold nanoparticles induce cell mediated responses accompanied by inflammatory natural killer (NK) cell stimulation, whereas 2 nm gold nanoparticles are more efficiently taken up without inducing dendritic cell maturation or lymphocyte proliferation. To summarize, the published data revealed strong effects of the GNP size and functionalization on production of proinflammatory cytokines.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "With some inspiration from data on GNP uptake by macrophages, Choi et al.\n",
      "22 even proposed a new method for the photothermal therapy of tumors that employs a “Trojan horse” in the form of monocytes and macrophages laden with phagocytosed GNSs. For these purposes, Dreaden et al.\n",
      "23 suggested the use of GNPs conjugated with macrolide antibiotics, which can accumulate in tumor-specific macrophages and induce their cytotoxicity, causing tumor cells to die. Thus, particle size and structure in these studies were not critical to macrophage uptake.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "The influence of colloidal gold on immunocompetent cells was examined in vivo also by Tian et al.\n",
      "24 and by Lou et al.\n",
      "25 In particular, injection of nonconjugated GNPs into mice enhanced the proliferation of lymphocytes and normal killers, as well as increasing the IL-2 production.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "Quite interesting data were acquired by Bastús et al.\n",
      "26,27 with 10 nm nonconjugated GNPs. From their results, it follows that indeed, on entry into murine bone marrow macrophages, GNPs do not affect the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, if the GNP surface is modified with the peptide AGIP (amyloid growth inhibitory peptide, LPFFD) or SAP [sweet arrow peptide, (VRLPPP)3], GNPs, on entry into the macrophages, involve the induction of NO synthase and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. In addition, they inhibit macrophage proliferation. The recognition of GNP–peptide conjugates was made more effective through toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) on the surface of the macrophages. Yet, Staroverov et al.\n",
      "28,29 demonstrated that both 15 nm nonconjugated GNPs and their conjugates with high- and low-molecular-weight antigens, on entry into rat peritoneal macrophages, enhance their respiratory activity and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 1). GNPs also have greatly increased the production of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-γ (Fig. 2). Lee et al.\n",
      "30 reported that the penetration of gold nanorods (GNRs) and SiO2-coated GNRs into macrophages induces the release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins, etc.) and the activation of immune response genes. Thus, in addition to early observations by Shukla et al.\n",
      "16 for bare GNPs, the published data26–29 indicate a significant role of surface coating in macrophage response after GNP uptake.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "The activation of macrophages by GNPs, found by several authors,26–28,30–34 can serve as a basis for new vaccine adjuvants. As in the usual cellular uptake, immunoactivity depends strongly on the particle size: 5 nm particles conjugated with disaccharides performed far better than smaller, 2 nm ones.35\n",
      "\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "Yet another means of activating macrophages with GNPs was proposed by Wei et al.\n",
      "36 For this purpose, they used 15 and 30 nm GNPs conjugated to cytosine–phosphate–guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides. As is known, these oligonucleotides are demethylated sites of microbial DNA that can activate macrophage immune response by interacting with the TLR-9 receptors and subsequently triggering a cascade of immune response signals. The immunostimulating activity of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs may be analogous to that of oligonucleotides from bacterial DNA.37 According to Wei et al.,36 GNP–CpG conjugates were effective in enhancing nanoparticle internalization in RAW264.7 macrophages, and they greatly increased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 (15 nm conjugates did so to a greater degree than 30 nm ones did). The immunostimulatory effect of GNP–CpG was much greater than that of native CpG at the same concentrations.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "A recent study38 examined the influence of the size of PEGylated GNPs on the activation of the TLR-9 receptors of RAW264.7 murine macrophages by CpG oligonucleotides. GNPs with diameters of 4, 11, 19, 35 and 45 nm inhibited CpG-induced elaboration of TNF-α and IL-6 and the activity of the TLR-9 receptors. This effect was markedly size dependent, with a peak for 4 nm GNPs, which penetrated the cells most intensively.\n",

      "Massich et al.\n",
      "39 reported on the immune response of macrophages after the phagocytosis of GNPs functionalized with polyvalent oligonucleotides. The effectiveness of uptake and the level of interferon production were found to depend on the density of DNA molecules on the GNP surface. Kim et al.\n",
      "40 showed that the uptake effectiveness of oligonucleotide-functionalized GNPs differs for cells isolated from peripheral blood (mononuclear cells) and those introduced into a 293T culture. In addition, only in the first type of cell did the uptake of GNP conjugates activate the expression of immune response genes.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "A recent article by Walkey et al.\n",
      "41 described a thorough study of the effect of coating GNPs with serum proteins and PEG on macrophage uptake. The authors studied the adsorption of 70 blood serum proteins to PEG-coated GNPs with different densities of PEG coating. Increasing the PEG coating density reduced serum protein adsorption and changed the composition of the adsorbed protein layer. Particle size also affected serum protein adsorption through a change in the steric interactions between the PEG molecules. Both the density of PEG molecules on the GNP surface and the size of GNPs determined the mechanism and effectiveness of macrophage uptake, possibly because the composition of the adsorbed blood serum proteins and their availability to cells were regulated. If the density of PEG coating was lower than ∼0.16 PEG molecules per nm2, the macrophage uptake of GNPs depended on the presence of adsorbed proteins (serum-dependent uptake). If the density was higher than ∼0.64 PEG molecules per nm2, serum-independent uptake was seen (Fig. 3).\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "Serum-dependent uptake was more effective than serum-independent uptake, apparently because of the difference in the energy of the GNP–cell interaction. Interestingly, serum-independent uptake was more effective for large GNPs (90 nm) whereas serum-dependent uptake was maximal for 50 nm GNPs.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "It should be noted that immediately on contact of GNPs with blood, lymph, gastric juice, or any other biological liquid in vivo the interaction between GNPs and solvable proteins and other biomolecules results in the formation of a protein “corona”.42,43 Similarly to the concept of functionalized GNPs, the concept of a GNP–protein corona is important in tuning the surface physicochemical properties of GNPs, such as charge, hydrodynamic size and colloidal stability. In fact, it is the GNP–protein corona that forms the first nano–bio interface and determines the first interactions of GNPs with/or within living cells. This is because the GNP–protein corona is a dynamic biopolymer layer that can strongly affect cellular uptake owing to modification of the particle properties (the overall size, charge, etc.). Although as much as 69 plasma proteins can bind to the GNP surface,44,45 only some of them, such as albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, complement and fibrinogen, are the most abundantly bound proteins forming the GNP–protein corona. After intravenous injection, the coating of GNPs by these proteins largely determines the particles' fate in the body—biodistribution over organs, tissues and cells, the efficiency of cellular uptake and clearance, immunological properties, and so on.46,47\n",

      "49 demonstrated that PEGylated GNPs were internalized more quickly by lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 cells than by unstimulated cells, reaching saturation within 24 h. The PEGylated GNPs enhanced LPS-induced production of NO and IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in RAW264.7 cells, partly by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-κB pathways.

      "51 studied the cellular uptake of GNPs with or without exposure of cells to latrunculin A, a phagocytosis inhibitor. The results indicate a size dependence of the internalization mechanisms for macrophage (THP-1) cells. The internalization of larger GNPs (15 and 35 nm) was blocked in the presence of latrunculin A, although they could attach to the cell membrane. Smaller GNPs (5 nm), though, were not blocked by actin-dependent processes.\n",
      "Interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells\n",
      "Of considerable interest are studies on the uptake of GNPs not only by macrophages but also by other cells of the immune system, in particular dendritic cells. In the past decade, dendritic cells have attracted increased interest owing to the ease of their isolation from peripheral blood monocytes and to their ability to effectively present antigens to T cells. By now, a great deal of work has been done on the modulation of immune response in patients with chronic infections and oncological diseases by using antigen-primed dendritic cells.52 GNPs have been named, among other carriers, for application in antigen delivery to dendritic cells. For example, Cheung et al.\n",
      "53 described the use of 15 nm GNPs for presenting a peptide antigen associated with Epstein–Barr virus to dendritic cells. According to their TEM data, peptide-functionalized GNPs penetrated the dendritic cell cytoplasm but were not found in the nuclei. The uptake of GNPs by dendritic cells resulted in an increased content of γ-interferon, the presentation by major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) of the antigen to CD4+ T cells, and, correspondingly, activation of an epitope-specific immune response by cytotoxic T cells.\n",

By TEM, LCM and flow cytometry, GNPs functionalized with the peptides and with Fc fragments of IgG were shown to interact with the Fcγ receptors of dendritic cells and were localized, upon uptake, in the cytoplasm in a diffuse way. Internalization of antigen-conjugated GNPs in dendritic cells brought about an increase in the immune response, as compared with the effect obtained from the use of the native antigen, which was manifested as enhanced lymphocyte proliferation. Such an approach, in the authors' opinion, opens up the way to the creation of an effective system for the development of antitumor and other vaccines.\n",

      "55 reported the effect of 10 nm non-antigen-functionalized GNPs on the immune functions of dendritic cells. From their findings, the GNPs that had entered cell endosomes were not cytotoxic and had no effect on the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. However, they did promote the secretion of interleukin IL-12p70, which is directly involved in the activation of T cells and, thus, in the regulation of an antigen-specific immune response. The authors also noted the development of long dendrites and an increase in the cell-surface amount of MHC-II molecules, which present antigens to T lymphocytes. Thus, even nonfunctionalized GNPs are immunostimulatory to both dendritic cells and macrophages.17\n",

In particular, Małaczewska59,60 demonstrated that mice, after being orally administered with GNPs, showed an increased activity of phagocytes and some changes in the lymphocyte phenotypes, i.e., an increased percentage of B and CD4+/CD8+ double positive T cells. The lowest dose had a pro-inflammatory or immunostimulating effect, enhancing the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α). The effect of the highest dose can be considered proinflammatory or immunotoxic, because the stimulated cytokine synthesis was accompanied by a drastic decline in the proliferative activity of lymphocytes.\n",

Particle shape was found to affect strongly the particle trapping by cells of the immune system; specifically, CTAB-coated GNRs (50 × 15 nm) could be trapped faster than CTAB-coated 15 and 50 nm gold nanospheres. Replacing CTAB by poly(ethylene oxide) greatly reduced uptake effectiveness for both types of GNPs. Nanoparticle uptake by the immune cells was accompanied by an activation of the genes of proinflammatory cytokines and by a corresponding change in the cell phenotype. A characteristic fact is that the “professionally” phagocytic cells took up GNPs two orders of magnitude more effectively than did, e.g., HeLa cells. In addition, Bartneck et al. revealed an alternative elimination mechanism whereby GNPs can be cleared from peripheral blood via an extracellular network (“trap”) produced by neutrophil granulocytes.\n",

      "The same group presented data67 on the uptake of GNPs into various cells of the reticuloendothelial system: monocytes, macrophages, immature and mature dendritic cells and endothelial cells. The greatest uptake ability was demonstrated by macrophages, endothelial cells and immature dendritic cells. Positively charged GNPs penetrated into cells of the reticuloendothelial system more effectively. Moreover, GNPs intensified the induction of several cytokines, including γ-interferon, IL-8 (both in dendritic cells and in macrophages), IL-1β and IL-6 (only in dendritic cells). Interestingly, in mature dendritic cells, GNPs accumulate in the MHC-II compartment and, consequently, may affect antigen processing.\n",

      "Phagocytic cells of the immune system have a multitude of various receptors on their surface, through which they bind and take up foreign material.68,69 The interactions with various types of receptors and, consequently, various types of GNP endocytosis depend in many ways on nanoparticle size and shape but especially on surface functionalization (including opsonization by proteins from the culture medium or blood plasma)70 and on the presence of mannose-containing polysaccharides on the GNP surface.71 Some researchers are inclined to believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors.72,73 These are mainly involved in the endocytosis of apoptotic cells. A characteristic peculiarity of their functioning, in contrast to the other macrophage receptors, is the absence of release of proinflammatory cytokines.\n",

      "More specifically, Patel et al.\n",
      "74 demonstrated that the uptake of GNPs functionalized with polyvalent oligonucleotides by mammalian cells is effected through scavenger receptors. Cell preincubation with fucoidan and polyinosinic acid, which are agonists for these receptors, decreased the uptake by 60% (Fig. 5). However, bafilomycin A1 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin did not inhibit GNP uptake, because these pharmacological agents are known to inhibit other modes of cellular entry. Coating of GNP conjugates with serum proteins also reduced uptake effectiveness.\n",

      "An in-depth study on the involvement of scavenger receptors in macrophage uptake of GNPs was published by França et al.\n",
      "75 Their data show that macrophages take up opsonized GNPs through SR-mediated pathways (both 30 and 150 nm GNPs), as well as through clathrin- and caveolin-dependent pinocytosis (only 30 nm GNPs). Thus, the smaller 30 nm particles use a broader range of internalization routes, in contrast to the larger 150 nm GNPs. Noteworthy is the fact that as demonstrated by inhibition analysis, phagocytosis began with an interaction of GNPs with scavenger receptors and was not attended by induction of proinflammatory cytokines.\n",

      "Since the 1920s, the immunological properties of colloidal metals (in particular, gold) have been attracting much research interest. This interest is mainly due to the physicochemical (nonspecific) theory of immunity proposed by J. Bordet, who postulated that immunogenicity, along with antigenic specificity, depends predominantly on the physicochemical properties of antigens, first of all on their colloidal state. L. A. Zilber made successful attempts to obtain agglutinating sera to colloidal gold76 (interestingly, a repeated attempt to prepare antisera to colloidal gold was performed almost 80 years later, in 2006).77 Yet, several authors have shown that the introduction of a complete antigen together with colloidal metals promotes the production of antibodies.78 Furthermore, some haptens may cause antibody production when adsorbed to colloidal particles.79 Numerous data on the influence of colloidal gold on nonspecific immune response are given in one of the best early reviews.80 In particular, it was noted that at 2 h after an intravenous injection of 5 mL of colloidal gold into rabbits, there was a sizable increase in total leucocytes in 1 mL of blood (from 10 000 to 19 800) against a slight decline in mononuclear cells (from 5200 to 4900) and a considerable increase in polynuclear cells (from 4700 to 14 900).81 On injection of other colloidal metals, no such phenomena were observed. Unfortunately, with advances in immunology and with denial of many postulates of Bordet's theory, interest in the immunological properties of colloids decreased. There is no doubt, though, that the data obtained on the enhancement of immune response to antigens adsorbed on colloidal particles were utilized for the development of various adjuvants.82,83\n",

      "It is known that antibody biosynthesis is induced by substances possessing sufficiently developed structures (immunogenicity). The substances include proteins, polysaccharides, and some synthetic polymers. However, many biologically active substances (vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, narcotics, etc.) have relatively small molecular masses and, as a rule, do not elicit a pronounced immune response. In standard methods of antibody preparation in vivo, this limitation is overcome by chemically attaching such substances (haptens) to high-molecular-weight carriers (most often proteins), which makes it possible to obtain specific antisera. However, such antisera usually contain attendant antibodies to the carrier's antigenic structures.87\n",

      "Let us take a brief look at two interrelated problems in current immunology that have attracted much research attention. These are the development of antibodies to nonimmunogenic low-molecular-weight compounds (haptens) and the creation of next-generation vaccines based on natural (microbial) or synthetic peptides.88–93 It is known that antibody biosynthesis is induced by substances possessing sufficiently developed structures (immunogenicity). These substances include proteins, polysaccharides, and some synthetic polymers.94 However, many biologically active substances (neurotransmitters, hormones, vitamins, antibiotics, etc.) have relatively small molecular masses. Low-molecular-weight antigens are in the category “weak antigens,” i.e., they do not elicit a pronounced immune response.\n",
      "Production of antibodies by using gold nanoparticles\n",
      "Because haptens are weakly immunogenic, the choice of an optimal carrier (delivery system) providing a high immune response, in parallel with the obtainment of pure enough antibody preparations, is an important task when producing antibodies to low-molecular-weight compounds. Traditionally, this problem is solved by chemical attachment of a hapten to a protein matrix called a schlepper (from the German schleppen “to drag”), and by the use of adjuvants and intensive schemes of animal immunization with the obtained conjugate.87,95 Bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, thyreoglobulin, hemocyanin and diphtheria or tetanus toxoids (in the case of synthetic peptides) are generally used as schleppers. However, this method yields antibodies to both the hapten and the immunodominant sites of the carrier. Note that when such a carrier is used, a pronounced immune response to weak antigens does not always develop. Besides, the subsequent purification and screening of the obtained antibodies are laborious and expensive, and their titre and affinity are often low. Most currently used adjuvants based on oil emulsions and on suspensions of inorganic substances are, as a rule, liable to phase separation, are often reactogenic, and their immunogenic properties vary with time. Many of these adjuvants cause local and systemic toxicity.82\n",

      "Production of antibodies by using gold nanoparticles\n",
      "In recent years, efforts have been made to develop “complex antigens”, i.e., artificial molecular complexes formed from both necessary antigens and carriers or/and adjuvants. In particular, synthetic polyelectrolytes (poly-l-lysine, polyacrylic acid, polyvinylpyridine, sulfonated polystyrene, ficoll, etc.) were proposed for use as adjuvants.96 These polymer compounds are produced by chain-radical polymerization of the corresponding monomers. The simplicity of polyelectrolyte composition and synthesis, the possibility of obtainment of polymer chains with a wide range of molecular masses (i.e., of various lengths), their solubility in water, and other properties (the capacity for conformational transitions, the formation of complexes with proteins, etc.) opened up possibilities for the use of polyelectrolytes in immunologic investigations. Such adjuvant carriers are capable of antigen deposition at the sites of injection, enhancement of antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells, and induction of production of necessary cytokines. However, the low immunogenicity of such complexes, due to their small epitope density, prompts researchers to look for new nontoxic and effective carriers additionally possessing adjuvant properties.\n",

Often the levels of specific antibodies produced in the immunization of animals with gold nanoparticles conjugated antigens were higher than that generated by classical adjuvants while the amount of antigen required to achieve this response was an order of magnitude lower than for immunization with a standard adjuvant.143 The reasons for this may be due to greater accumulation of the antigen in cells such as dendritic cells allowing greater presentation of the therapeutic antigen to the immune system.

If the gene expression is effective, these proteins serve as antigens for the development of an immune response.181,182 In the early papers, immunization was conducted by a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of a “naked” DNA. However, for this purpose, a “biolistic” transfection, using GNPs, began to be applied almost simultaneously. It was found to be very effective, apparently because of the multiplicity of sites of transgene interaction with tissues and because of transgene penetration directly into cells and nuclei.183,184 The method of gene immunization, often called DNA vaccination, which was well-developed in experiments with animals, has shown high efficiency especially in respect of viral infections: tick-borne encephalitis, HIV infection, hepatitis B, and some others.185\n",

One can expect that DNA immunization will be among the most effective gene-therapy methods in the coming years.186–188\n",

It was found that animal immunization with colloidal gold–antigen conjugates (with or without the use of Freund's complete adjuvant) yielded specific, high-titer antibodies to a variety of antigens, with no concomitant antibodies.

      "All the above facts show decisively that GNPs possesses adjuvant properties. With use of GNPs as an antigen carriers they activated the phagocytic activity of macrophages and influenced the functioning of lymphocytes (see above), which apparently may be responsible for their immunomodulating effect. It also was found that GNPs and their conjugates with low- and high-molecular weight antigens stimulate the respiratory activity of cells of the reticuloendothelial system and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes,28 which possibly determines the adjuvant properties of colloidal gold. That GNPs act as both an adjuvant and a carrier (i.e., they present haptens to T cells) seems the most interesting aspect of manifestation of immunogenic properties by colloidal gold. In particular, GNPs conjugated to antigens were found to influence the activation of T cells: a tenfold increase in proliferation, as compared with that observed on the addition of the native antigen, was found. This fact shows that there is a fundamental possibility of targeted activation of T cells followed by macrophage activation and pathogen killing.\n",

This fact has also been confirmed by researchers studying the mechanism of action of DNA vaccines and using gold particles to deliver genetic material to cells.206 The role of Kupffer and Langerhans cells in the development of immune response was shown in those investigations.

It remains unclear, then, how this process can proceed with a hapten. The hypothesis of the multivalent antigen, i.e., the antigen formed because of the high local concentration of univalent antigens on the surface of a gold particle, does not answer this question either.

With the use of such nanoparticles, the immunogenicity of a loaded substance and its representation in a host immune system will be changed.

      "The evident advantages of biodegradable nanoparticles is their complete utilization in the vaccinated organism, high loading efficiency for the target substance, enhanced ability to cross various physiological barriers, and low systemic side effects. In all likelihood, the immune action of biodegradable nanoparticles and GNPs as corpuscular carriers are similar. Keeping in mind the recent data for the low toxicity of GNPs and their efficient excretion by the hepatobiliary system, we expect that both nanoparticle classes – GNPs and biodegradable nanoparticles – will compete on equal footing for the development of next-generation vaccines.\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "Thus, GNP uptake into cells of the immune system activates the production of proinflammatory cytokines, a finding which indicates directly that GNPs are immunostimulatory. The activation of immune cells by GNPs, shown by several authors, may serve as a basis to develop new vaccine adjuvants. As in the case of the usual cells, interactions with various types of receptors on the surface of immune cells and, correspondingly, various types of GNP endocytosis depend largely on the surface functionalization of GNPs. Many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. However, the interaction of functionalized GNPs with cells of the immune system is still far from being understood in more or less detail and requires further study.236\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "In conclusion, it may be said that the time is probably right to talk of not only the biochemistry but also the biophysics of immune response, because it is the unique biophysical properties of metallic particles—in particular, the surface charge and the electrostatic field of the particle (influencing, in a certain manner, the charge, orientation and polarization of the antigen molecules adsorbed on the particles)—that have to significantly affect the immune-response process.\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "Thus, the GNPs can serve as adjuvants to improve the effectiveness of vaccines, stimulate antigen-presenting cells, and provide controlled release of antigens. In addition, the immunogenicity of CNPs is determined by the physicochemical properties of particles such as size, shape, charge and surface functionalization. Study of the immune response characteristics when using GNPs as a carrier and adjuvant for the production of antibodies will allow evaluating their potential for the development of effective vaccines.\n"
